## Ecosystem Projects

Main projects in Kubeflow:

* [Kubeflow Main Repository](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow) which provides the front-end to access major components of Kubeflow.
* [Katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib) is a Kubernetes-native project for automated machine learning (AutoML).
* [Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines) is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable, and scalable with Kubeflow.
* [Training Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator) provides Kubernetes custom resources that makes it easy to run distributed or non-distributed TensorFlow/PyTorch/Apache MXNet/XGBoost/MPI jobs on Kubernetes.
* [Arena](https://github.com/kubeflow/arena) is a CLI for Kubeflow.
* [Fairing](https://github.com/kubeflow/fairing) is a Python SDK for building, training, and deploying ML models.


Other open source projects that use Argo:

* [Couler](https://github.com/couler-proj/couler) provides a unified interface for constructing and managing workflows on different workflow engines.
* [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro) is an open-source Python framework for creating reproducible, maintainable and modular data science code.
* [Seldon](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core) is an MLOps framework to package, deploy, monitor and manage thousands of production machine learning models.
* [SQLFlow](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/sqlflow) extends SQL to support AI and compiles the SQL program to a workflow that runs on Kubernetes.
* [MLRun](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun) is an open MLOps platform for quickly building and managing continuous ML applications across their lifecycle.
* [Polyaxon](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon) is a platform for building, training, and monitoring large scale deep learning applications.
