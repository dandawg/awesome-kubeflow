# Awesome Kubeflow

ðŸŽ‰ [Kubeflow has applied to come a CNCF incubating project!](https://blog.kubeflow.org/kubeflow-applied-cncf-incubating/) Stay tuned!

ðŸ”” Links to recordings for talks from various conferences, such as ArgoCon and KubeCon, are added as soon as they become available!

A curated list of awesome projects and resources related to [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/).

## What is Kubeflow?

The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable.

## Ecosystem Projects

Main projects in Kubeflow:
* [Katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib) is a Kubernetes-native project for automated machine learning (AutoML).
* [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines) is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable, and scalable with Kubeflow.
* [Training Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator) provides Kubernetes custom resources that makes it easy to run distributed or non-distributed TensorFlow/PyTorch/Apache MXNet/XGBoost/MPI jobs on Kubernetes.

Other open source projects that use Argo:

* [Couler](https://github.com/couler-proj/couler) provides a unified interface for constructing and managing workflows on different workflow engines.
* [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro) is an open-source Python framework for creating reproducible, maintainable and modular data science code.
* [Seldon](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core) is an MLOps framework to package, deploy, monitor and manage thousands of production machine learning models.
* [SQLFlow](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/sqlflow) extends SQL to support AI and compiles the SQL program to a workflow that runs on Kubernetes.

## Books

* [Distributed Machine Learning Patterns](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/distributed-ml-patterns) teaches you how to take machine learning models from your personal laptop to large distributed clusters. Youâ€™ll explore key concepts and patterns behind successful distributed machine learning systems, and learn technologies like TensorFlow, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, and Argo Workflows with real-world scenarios and hands-on projects.
